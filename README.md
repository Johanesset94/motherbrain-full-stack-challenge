# Motherbrain Full Stack Challenge

Hello! :wave:

Please fork this repo.

To begin the challenge, you have to have need a copy of the secret `.env` file, saved to `/backend/` folder of this project.

Next, run `yarn dev` in `/backend/` and `yarn dev` in `/frontend/` project and go to
[localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) when everything is built and ready.
There you'll find more information.

Good Luck!

# Solution

## To run
Same as above, except it's `yarn dev` for frontend as well. 

## Pages
I've implemented a company search, with company pages: 

[localhost:3000/search](http://localhost:3000/search)

I've also implemented a fundings timeline with simple filter and sort:

[localhost:3000/fundings](http://localhost:3000/fundings)
